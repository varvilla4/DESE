# Problem Overview
This project tackles various data analysis tasks to help the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) in Massachusetts evaluate and improve the state's public education system. As a data analyst, you will use SQL queries to extract insights from the DESE database (dese.db). The primary goal is to ensure that DESE can make informed decisions regarding the quality of education in Massachusetts, focusing on areas such as resource allocation, district performance, graduation rates, and teacher evaluations.

## Database Description
The database (dese.db) contains multiple tables related to the public education system in Massachusetts. These tables model relationships between districts, schools, expenditures, staff evaluations, and graduation rates. Below is an overview of the core entities:

 - Districts: Represent the school districts in Massachusetts, each responsible for overseeing multiple schools.
 - Schools: Contain data about public and charter schools within the districts.
 - Expenditures: Track how much each district spends, including per-pupil expenditures.
 - Staff Evaluations: Measure the performance of staff in each district, particularly focusing on exemplary teachers.
 - Graduation Rates: Contain the percentage of students graduating from each school.
   
These entities are linked through relationships that help answer the data-driven questions posed by DESE.
